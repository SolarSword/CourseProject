# Requirement Confirmation
What project is going to implement is not clear in the *Aims* section in the main README.md file. So this project is the to help to comfirm all the project function details so that you can take this document as your standard for coding and testing. Actually if you got an project assignment from you actual professor during your real course learning in university, you also need to make every requirement clear before coding or technical design. If no detailed requirement document is provided, you need to write one for yourself. 

At the same time, it needs to be emphasized that this is not a commercial project, so some requirements will not overemphasize the completeness of the functions. Also this is a **REQUIREMENT** document, which means that this article will not consider the code implementation in detail, but will only describe the system based on functional requirements.

# Requirement Details
## System Overall
This Academic Affairs System is mainly used for course selection & cancelation, notification publication & viewing, assignment publication & submitting and score calculation. These functions are designed to work at different time phase. Also, besides the role related functions, the system itself also need to support some basic function workflow.
### Phase Definition of The System
- <font color=Red>**Course Selection Phase**</font>
In this phase, students can select and cancel thier selection of courses. <u>But students couldn't select the courses that they have already taken in the last course selection phase.</u> <u>Also professors couldn't publish any course or change the published course info in this phase but still can register a new course. </u>Only administartor can help a professor to publish a registered course or change the course info. And only administartor can configure the phase duration or force an end to this phase. 
- <font color=Red>**Usual Phase**</font>
Except Course Selection Phase, all the rest is usual phase. In this phase, professor can register a new course but <u>as long as he/she doesn't publish it, students can't see this course.</u> One he/she publishes this newly registered course, students can see and select it in the next Course Selection Phase.

### Score Calculation
The system should also support the score calculation. Professor needs to set the proportions of different scores when publishing a course and the system would calculate the course final score of a student once the professor sumbits all the scores. After all the scores of one course are submitted, the system should support calculation of score statistics, which are <u>**average score, median score, highest score, lowest score, score distribution**</u>.

### Course Status Change
At particular time, the system can change the course status automatically:
- If a course is newly published, the status is **Reviewing**.
- If the course selection is in progress, convert all the ongoing courses to **Selection In Progress**.
- After the deadline of course selection, convert all the courses which meets the conditions for starting the course to **Normal Teaching**, those don't to **Canceled**
- After professor confirms the end of this course, convert correspoding course status to **Course Ended**.
## Object Definition
### Course & Course Module
A basic course contains such info:
**Course ID, Course Name, College, Credit, Brief**.

If a Course is just registered without publication, it is not visible to students. Professor needs to publish a Course Module based on a Course so that students can see it in the system and select it. Every semester, professors need to publish new Course Modules based on the same Course to refresh Course information. So Course Module is the specific course object and contains the details: **Course Module ID, Professor, Teach Assistant, Semester, Classroom Location, Class Period, Duration, Course Capacity and Score Composition Ratio**. The following chart shows the specific explanation of these infos.

## Function & Workflow Definition
### Course Selection 
![Course Selection](image/course_selection.png)

Only when there is available course module and the course selection phase is created by administrator, student can select or cancel selected course. 
Also at **usual phase**, professor can edit the course and course module and administrator can help a student to be enrolled into a course module which still doesn't meet the maximum capacity.

### Assignment, Project, Quiz or Exam
![Assignment, Projectm Quiz or Exam](image/assignment.png)

Before the assignment/project deadline, students can submit as many times as they want but the system will only keep the last submit. Professor need to first submit and then confirm score, otherwise students won't be able to see it. Quiz/Exam is similar to assignment/project workflow but the system won't support online quiz/exam, so theoretically professors can submit score immediately after publishing quiz/exam.

## The Generate Rules of All Kinds IDs & Predefined String
### IDs
- Course ID: College name abbreviation + Recommended university year for course enrollment + Sequentially generated 4-digit course ID

- College ID: 3-digit numeric ID, generated in order
  - Example: 001 or 002

- Course Module ID: Course ID + 4-digit random alphanumeric code
  - Example: CS40045-X4b0

- User ID: Randomly generated 8 digit int32 ID
  - Example: 66518090

- Student/Teach Assistant ID: ST + Enrollment year + College ID + Sequentially generated 4-digit course ID
  - Example: get enrolled in 2015, college ID: 010, The 126th student enrolled to this college this year -- ST20150100126

- Professor/Faculty ID: FA + Employment year + College/Department ID + Sequentially generated 4-digit course ID

## Other Functional Requirement Details
- Credit Gaining: If a student's final score of a course module is greater or equal to 60, then he/she will gain the credit of this course. (This project does not consider make-up exams and retakes for the time being.)
- If the total students who select the same course module are less than its min number of students , then the corresponding course module won't enroll any students.
- A course module will be ended automatically after its duration. If students check his/her final score before the professor submits and confirms, he/she will get "Unannounced" instead. But student can still view the project/assignment score which is already announced.
- Except for a small number of unreasonable operations, administrators always have the highest permission. But an administrator can't select a course module or create/publish course/course module for himself/herself, he/she can only do such for a professor or a student.
