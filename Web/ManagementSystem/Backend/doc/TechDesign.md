# Tech Design
Tech design document is to solidate as much implementation details as possible. It should cover macro system architecture chart, data structure schema design, database table design, logic flow chart and other UMLs. The most important thing is to help developers sort out their design and implementation ideas before actually writing code. Tech design documents can also serve as a reference when reviewing a project in the future.
# Overall Architecute
Considering the system usage scale, complex desgin won't be introduced into this project.

The Management Service is main component of this system. Considering the project implementation and debugging difficulty, SQLite as the database is enough. As there is a requirement in the requirement document, to update the course module status automatically, a cron job Course Status Job component is needed.

`**HIGHLIGHT**: In actual projects, course selection is a very complex process and it is a typical high-concurrency scenario in a short period of time. To solve this, not only the optimization of code logic level, but also the introduction of new middleware components, deployment of service instances and many other aspects will be taken into consideration. However, these contents are not the focus of this project, so the architectural design has been extremely simplified.`
