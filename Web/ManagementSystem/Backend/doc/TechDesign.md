# Tech Design
Tech design document is to solidate as much implementation details as possible. It should cover macro system architecture chart, data structure schema design, database table design, logic flow chart and other UMLs. The most important thing is to help developers sort out their design and implementation ideas before actually writing code. Tech design documents can also serve as a reference when reviewing a project in the future.
